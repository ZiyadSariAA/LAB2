     career at Sporting CP in Portugal. His incredible <em> speed,
        skill,</em> and work ethic quickly caught the attention of major European clubs.

    <sup><span></span>a UEFA Champions League title, and his first Ballon d'Or in 2008,
        marking him as one of the greatest in the game.</sup>
